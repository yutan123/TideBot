/// This class implements the J-curve back-out position curve and
/// [Curves.linearToEaseOut] size curve that together create the
/// iOS 26 liquid teardrop morphing effect.
///
/// It is **intentionally stateless** — feed it the raw animation value plus
/// the source/destination geometry and it returns a fully computed
/// [LiquidMorphState] for that frame. No `BuildContext`, no `State`, no
/// `ChangeNotifier` dependencies.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// Two conceptual blobs drive the morph:
///
/// - **Blob A** (anchor / ghost trigger) stays at the trigger position and
///   shrinks away over the first 40 % of the animation to cleanly break the
///   liquid bridge.
/// - **Blob B** (menu body) travels from the trigger center to the menu
///   center along a J-curve overshoot trajectory, expanding from trigger size
///   to menu size.
///
/// The metaball SDF shader automatically creates the teardrop neck between the
/// two blobs — there is no explicit neck geometry.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Typically called from an AnimatedBuilder or addListener callback.
/// final state = LiquidMorphPhysics.compute(
///   rawValue: controller.value,
///   finalDx: finalDx,
///   finalDy: finalDy,
///   horizontalOffset: _horizontalOffset,
///   verticalOffset: _verticalOffset,
/// );
///
/// // Apply to the UI:
/// Positioned(
///   left: triggerX + state.pushDx,
///   top:  triggerY + state.pushDy,
///   child: Transform.scale(scale: state.anchorScale, child: blobA),
/// )
/// ```
